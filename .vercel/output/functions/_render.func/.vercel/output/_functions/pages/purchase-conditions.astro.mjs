Welcome to fashionCulture. Please read these Purchase
                    Conditions carefully before placing your order. By making a
                    purchase, you agree to the terms outlined below.

When you place an order on our website, you will receive an
                    email confirmation. This confirmation does not constitute
                    acceptance of your order, but rather a confirmation that we
                    have received it. All orders are subject to availability and
                    acceptance by fashionCulture.

We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order for any
                    reason, including but not limited to product availability,
                    errors in the description or price of the product, or an
                    error in your order.
</p> </div> <div class="content-block" data-astro-cid-4hbih55h> <h2 data-astro-cid-4hbih55h>Pricing and Payment</h2> <p data-astro-cid-4hbih55h>

                    include any applicable taxes. We strive to ensure that all
                    pricing information is accurate; however, errors may occur.
                    If we discover an error in the price of any item you have
                    ordered, we will inform you as soon as possible and give you
                    the option to reconfirm your order at the correct price or
                    cancel it.
</p> <p data-astro-cid-4hbih55h>
We accept a variety of payment methods, including credit
                    cards, debit cards, and [other payment options]. Payment is
                    taken at the time of order placement. If we are unable to
                    fulfill your order, we will issue a full refund to your
                    original payment method.
